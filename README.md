# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Hello my name is Daniel Park I am a front end developer, this is a repository that contains code for my Profile website. The purpose of this website is to display some of my projects that worked on and or made. This project is built on CSS, React and React Router, if you refresh the page it will show the page you are currently on instead of going back to the home page.

Some of the challenges that I encountered was CSS layout issues, the layout was unsatifactory, and encountering some warnings from React. The warnings from React was not utilizing hooks and using the .map() array method to display the components. Some of the other challenges that were encountered was determining what kind of pages to display to the user, such as a contact page or an about page. Some features of the website that I plan to improve is CSS layout to make the site look better. With any project there is always room for improvement.

The svg files for Github, phone, LinkedIn, and Gmail icons can be downloaded from these sites:

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me. HAPPY CODING!!!
